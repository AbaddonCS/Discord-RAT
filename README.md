    - File management
    - Potential to drop further files
    - Spyware / surveillance features
- Fast as fuck
- Compiles to a C binary, close to hardware

## How to use
- **MUST: [Install Nim](https://nim-lang.org/install.html)**
- Download this repo
- Since this needs a Discord bot token, go create a discord bot and get your token.
- Replace the token in the `Bot.nim` script
- Run `Compile.bat`, which will sort out everything for you
- Done! stub is in dist folder.
